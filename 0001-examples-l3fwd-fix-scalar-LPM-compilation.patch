Subject: [PATCH] examples/l3fwd: fix scalar LPM compilation

The lpm_process_event_pkt() can either process a packet using an
architecture specific (defined for X86/SSE, ARM/Neon and PPC64/Altivec)
path or a scalar one. The choice is however done using an ifdef
pre-processor macro. Because of that the scalar version was apparently
not widely excersized/compiled.
Due to some copy/paste errors, the scalar logic in
lpm_process_event_pkt() retained a "continue" statement where a BAD_PORT
should be returned after refactoring of the LPM logic in the l3fwd
example.

Fixes: 99fc91d18082 ("examples/l3fwd: add event lpm main loop")
